## 0. Introduction
- Linked List Operations:
    - `Insertion`:
        - at head
        - at tail
        - at any position
    - `Deletion`:
        - at head
        - at tail
        - at any position

        - backward
    - `Sorting`:
        - ascending
        - descending
- These topics we will covered two modules - `Module 06` and `Module 07`
- `Module 06` topics will `Insertion` and `Printing`
- `Module 07` topics will `Deletion` and `Sorting`

## 1. Reference of a pointer
- Program: `pointer_reference.cpp`
- The topics is `reference of a pointer`
- Access to `fun()` function with `reference (&)`
- When `reference (&)` are not use to `fun()` function parameter then can't access to `fun()` function.
