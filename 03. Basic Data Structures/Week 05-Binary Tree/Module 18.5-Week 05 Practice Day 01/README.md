## 0. Height and Depth of a binary tree
- Understand and explore to `Binary Tree Height` with this draw:

    - <img src="./images/drawing3.png" width="500">
    - `This way to height count - Drawing...`
    - `Height are always count with maximum number.`
    - `Height - was leaf nodes are 0 and root node was n numbers`
- Understand and explore to `Binary Tree Depth` with this draw:

    - `Depth - was root node are 0 and leaf nodes was n numbers`
