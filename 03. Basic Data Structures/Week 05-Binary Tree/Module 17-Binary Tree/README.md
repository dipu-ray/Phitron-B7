## 0. Introduction
- A guide to tree data structures
- We will learn to `binary tree` from `tree data structures`.
- `Tree data structure`: Introduction
- `The binary tree`: A special case
- `Creating a binary tree`: step-by-step
- `Traversal techniques`: Exploring the tree
- `Conclusion`: Key takeaways
- `Recursion` needed in tree for printout or others
- There haven't `STL - Standard Template Library`
- This is a `non-linear` data structures

## 1. What is Tree Data Structure
- `Hierarchy` concept in Tree. Also follow to `Hierarchial` data structures.
- Example with Tree:
    - Start to `Root`
    - End to `Leaf`
- Tree link to each others like this:
    - <img src="./images/drawing.png" width="500">
- This image data can't store by arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues or others. Only can do it `tree data structures`

## 2. Why we need to learn Tree Data Structure
- <img src="./images/drawing3.png" width="500">
- This `tree` data structure compare to others data structures, can write `others data structures` for `tree`.
- Another Example with Tree:
    - <img src="./images/drawing4.png" width="500">
- <img src="./images/drawing5.png" width="500">
- `They have connect with parent and child`
- `root node don't have parent node`
- `leaf node don't have child node`

## 3. Real life application of Tree Animated
- Real Life Example with This PC:
    - <img src="./images/drawing6.png" width="500">

## 4. What is Binary Tree
- Every node child max are two, then that's is `binary tree`.
- `0, 1, 2 (Child)`. You don't use that after two max child. Like - `3, 4, 5 (Child) don't use that`.
- `Binary Tree`:
    - <img src="./images/drawing7.png" width="500">
- `Not A Binary Tree`:
    - <img src="./images/drawing8.png" width="500">

## 5. Creating a Binary Tree
- Two type of Tree:
    - `Binary Tree` - Max 2 (Child)
    - `N-ary Tree` - Max n (Child)
- Pointing to the node:
