## 0. Introduction
- Exploring Stacks: A Data Structure Deep Dive
- LIFO - Stacks follow the `Last In, First Out (LIFO)` principle
- Implementing stacks using `Arrays`
- Implementing stacks using `STL List`
- Implementing stacks using `Doubly Linked Lists`

## 1. What is Stack Animated
- Explain this video with animated way `Stack of Plates` & `Stack of Chairs`.
- `Push()`- Push() value with top:

    - <img src="./images/drawing2.png" width="500">
    - <img src="./images/drawing3.png" width="500">
- `Pop()` - Pop() value with top:
    - <img src="./images/drawing4.png" width="500">
    - <img src="./images/drawing5.png" width="500">
    - <img src="./images/drawing6.png" width="500">
- You can `Push()` on top and you can `Pop()` will the top

## 2. Real life application of Stack Animated
- Real life implementation of STACK
- Example with a browser. Browser can go to enter a website and back from a website. That's mean forward and backward of a browser.
- Forward with `Push()` on top and Backward with `Pop()` on top in `STACK`
- STACK follow the technique is `LIFO technique`
- STACK help to `Crack The Interview`

## 3. What is stack
- Stack:
    - `Abstract Data Structure`
    - `Higher level Data Structure`
- Example with `Stack of Plates`
- Example with `Stack of Chairs`
- `LIFO` technique follow that's means that is `Stack`
- `Stack` implementation with `Arrays` and `Linked List`
- `Stack` there have don't access to stack middle or stack bottom, they have access to only on the top.
- `Array` can work with stack, `Linked List` can work with stack, `Vector` can work with stack and `STL` can work with stack.
- Stack Operations:
    - `push()`
    - `pop()`
    - `top()`
    - `size()`
    - `empty()`
