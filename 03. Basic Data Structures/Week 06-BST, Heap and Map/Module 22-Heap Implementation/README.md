## 0. Introduction
- Learn and explore to Complete `Binary Trees` and `Heaps`
- Complete Binary Trees: `A Primer`
- Array Representation of Complete Binary Trees
- Introducing Heaps: A Specialized Binary Tree
- All programming languages have `Heaps STL`
- `Insertion` into a Heap
- `Deletion` from a Heap

## 1. What is Complete Binary Tree
- Complete Binary Trees have must be a left child

- Complete Binary Tree hight are `h -> O(log n)`

## 2 Array representation of complete binary tree
- A Complete Binary Tree convert to Arrays:

    - <img src="./images/drawing3.png" width="500">
    - The Formula (Go to parent to child):
        - `parentIndex * 2 + 1 = leftIndex`
        - `parentIndex * 2 + 2 = rightIndex`
    - The Formula (Go to child to parent):
        - `(childIndex - 1) / 2 = parentIndex`

## 3 What is heap
- Heap are two types:
    - `Max Heap`
    - `Min Heap`
- `Max Heap`
    - `Max heap return to a big value` and `Max Heap` also better than `sort()`.

- `Min Heap`
    - `Min heap return to a small value`
