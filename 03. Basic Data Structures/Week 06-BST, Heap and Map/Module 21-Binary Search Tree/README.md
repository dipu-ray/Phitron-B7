## 1. What is BST
- `BST - Binary Search Tree`
- What is `BST`?
    - `Binary search` + `binary tree` they are two combined to make `binary search tree`.
    - BST is binary tree and you can search into binary search in binary tree.
- `BST` two conditions are maintain:
    - `all values of left sub-tree < node->val`
    - `all values of right sub-tree > node->val`

- `BST - Binary Search Tree` - left side child are smaller than root and right side child are bigger than root.
