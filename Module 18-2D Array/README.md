## 1. Why we need 2D array
- There have so many arrays. Like 10k array or 100k+ arrays
- Then we need to `2D arrays`
- `1D means` - They have 1 (one) dimension `Length`. Example: A Line size have one part, length.
- `2D means` - They have 2 (two) dimension `Length` and `Width`. Example: A Square size have two part, length and width.
- `3D means` - They have 3 (three) dimension `Length`, `Width` and `Height`. Example: A Box size have three part, length, width and height.
- `2D array` - There have fixed array in 2D arrays.
    - `0 index arrays - 5 size of array`
    - `1 index arrays - 5 size of array`
    - `2 index arrays - 5 size of array`
    - `nth index arrays - 5 size of array`
