## 1. Why we need 2D array
- There have so many arrays. Like 10k array or 100k+ arrays
- Then we need to `2D arrays`
- `1D means` - They have 1 (one) dimension `Length`. Example: A Line size have one part, length.
- `2D means` - They have 2 (two) dimension `Length` and `Width`. Example: A Square size have two part, length and width.
- `3D means` - They have 3 (three) dimension `Length`, `Width` and `Height`. Example: A Box size have three part, length, width and height.
- `2D array` - There have fixed array in 2D arrays.
    - `0 index arrays - 5 size of array`
    - `1 index arrays - 5 size of array`
    - `2 index arrays - 5 size of array`
    - `nth index arrays - 5 size of array`

## 2. What is 2D array
- 2D Array Draw:
    ![2D arrays draw image](./images/draw.png)
- How to declare 2D arrays:
    - a[row_number][column_number]
- It's also similar to matrix concept

## 3. Declaring 2D array
- Program: `2d_array.c`

## 4. 2D array input and output
- `2d_array2.c`

## 5. 2D array input and output Animated
- Explanation this `2d_array2.c` program.

## 6. Printing specific row and column
- Program: `row_column.c`

## 7. Printing specific row and column Animated
- Explanation this `row_column.c` program.

## 8. Types of matrix
- Image with example matrix
- Order of matrix
- Type of matrix:
    - Row matrix
    - Column matrix or Vector matrix
    - Zero matrix or Null matrix
    - Diagonal matrix
    - Scalar matrix
    - Unit matrix

## 9. Checking row, column and square matrix
- Program: `checking_row_matrix.c`
