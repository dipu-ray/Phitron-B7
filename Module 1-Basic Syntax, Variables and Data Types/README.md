## 1. Course Overview
- What is Programming?
    - Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions, or code, that a computer can follow to perform specific tasks, enabling humans to communicate with and control computers.

- Why do we need to learn programming?
    - We need to learn programming to solve problems efficiently, build real-world applications, automate tasks, boost career opportunities, and understand how technology works in our digital world and it's so fast working rather than human.

- What is a Programming Language?
    - A programming language is a set of instructions or commands that humans use to communicate with computers, allowing them to execute specific tasks and create software, applications, and other digital technologies.

- Which programming language should I start with?
    - C programmig language.

- Why choose c programming language?
    - C is called the "mother of all programming languages." It teaches you how software works under the hoodâ€”memory management, pointers, and low-level operations.

- The history of c programming language?
    - A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system. During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity.

## 2. Introduction
- We will covered:
    - Basic structure of c program
    - Printing in c
    - Taking input in c
    - Variables and data types
    - Data types limitations
    - Variable naming rules

## 3. Basic Structure of C Programming Animated
- Humnan body have two parts, head and body. Same to in c programming have two part head and body.
- Basic structure in c programming:
    | Head | Body |
    |----------|----------|
    | Header Files | int main() |

## 4. First C Program Animated 
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

## 5. Running our first code

## 6. Printing in C
- \t = Tab
- \n = New line

## 7. Variables and Data Types Animated
