## 0. Introduction
- `Week 01` we was learned to `Graph`. `Graph` have 2 (two) traversal algorithms - `BFS and DFS`. Then how to `2D Grid` relationship with `Graph` that was understand.
- Today problems are this topics related, also `Week 01`. This six problem you solved then you can realize and understand `BFS and DFS` which time to apply which one.

## 1. Island Perimeter part I
