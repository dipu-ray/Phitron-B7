## Course Introduction
- `Introduction to Algorithms`
- This is the process of works. That can also follow to steps. There are algorithms we have already done:
    - `Binary Search`
    - `Binary - Preorder, Inorder, Postorder`
- You can called to `Algorithms` of any process. `Some sequence of steps/instructions to solve a problem`

## 0. Introduction
