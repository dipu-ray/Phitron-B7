## Course Introduction
- `Introduction to Algorithms`
- This is the process of works. That can also follow to steps. There are algorithms we have already done:
    - `Binary Search`
    - `Binary - Preorder, Inorder, Postorder`
- You can called to `Algorithms` of any process. `Some sequence of steps/instructions to solve a problem`

## 0. Introduction
- `Graph Data Structures`: A Deep Dive
- What is a Graph?
- Types of Graphs
- Understanding `Real-World Applications` of Graphs
- Graph Input
- Graph Representations
    - `Adjacency Matrix`
    - `Adjacency List`
    - `Edge List`
- Comparison: `Adjacency Matrix` VS `Adjacency List` VS `Edge List`

## 1. What is Graph
- `Graph` is a Data Structures and graphs have some algorithms.
- `Graph` is parent and his child also `Tree`

- `Graph VS Tree`:

    - <img src="./images/drawing4.png" width="500">
    - <img src="./images/drawing5.png" width="500">
- You can make more differences with `Graph` and `Tree` and main differences `Cycle`. You check are every differences are `Cycle`

## 2. Types of Graph
- `Types of Graph`:
    - `Direction`:
        - `a. Directed`
        - `b. Undirected`
    - `Weight`:
        - `a. Weighted`
        - `b. Unweighted`
    - `Cycle`:
        - `a. Cyclic`
        - `b. Acyclic`
- `Direction`:
    - <img src="./images/drawing7.png" width="500">
- `Weight`:
    - <img src="./images/drawing8.png" width="500">
- `Cycle`:
    - <img src="./images/drawing9.png" width="500">
- `Directed` cycle make with `2 (two) nodes` but `Undirected` cycle make with `3 (three) nodes` needed.

## 3. Types of Graph Animated
- `Types of Graph explanation with animated way in this video`:
    - `Direction`:
        - `a. Directed`
        - `b. Undirected`
    - `Weight`:
        - `a. Weighted`
        - `b. Unweighted`
    - `Cycle`:
        - `a. Cyclic`
        - `b. Acyclic`

## 4. Real life example of graph I
- The real life example of graph is `Google Map`
- `Google Map` using are `Graph Algorithms`. Those locate area are thinking as a google map all are nodes.

## 5. Real life example of graph II
- The real life example of graph is `Facebook Friends`
- They are connected to each other and see the mutual friend.

## 6. Input graph
- How to input in Graph this logic building with drawing:
    - <img src="./images/drawing10.png" width="500">
- We can input into store are 3 ways:
    - `Adjacency Matrix`
    - `Adjacency List`
    - `Edge List`

## 7. Adjacency Matrix
- Graph and input logic build with drawing:
    - <img src="./images/drawing11.png" width="500">
    - <img src="./images/drawing12.png" width="500">
    - <img src="./images/drawing13.png" width="500">

## 8. Adjacency Matrix Implementation
- Program: `adjacency_matrix.cpp`

## 9. Adjacency Matrix Animated
- Explanation those logic with animated way in this video:
