## 0. Introduction
- Learn and explore to `Dynamic Programming`.
- `Dynamic Programming` have two types of approach:
    - `Top Down`
    - `Bottom Up`
- `Dynamic Programming` mainly work on recursion optimization.
- `Recursion` must be exert for in `Dynamic Programming`.

## 1. What is Dynamic Programming
- `Dynamic Programming` means `recursion + optimization`.
- When recursive solution have to duplicate or repeat to call then make to optimized recursion, that also call to `Dynamic Programming`.
- `Dynamic Programming` have two types of approach:
    - `Top Down -> Using with Recursion`
    - `Bottom Up -> Using with Loop`

## 2. Recursion recap
- Program: `recursion.cpp`

## 3. Factorial with recursion
