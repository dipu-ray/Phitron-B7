## 0. Introduction
- `A sorting algorithms` name is `Merge Sort`.
- Normally we was learned `Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort - O(N^2)` - This `O(N^2)` complexity was too much bad. There have a `C++` build in `Sort Function`. Because, this `C++` build in `Sort Function` time complexity have `O(NlogN)`. `Merge Sort` time complexity was `O(NlogN)`.
- This `Merge Sort` follow or using concept of `Divide & Conquer`. `Divide & Conquer` this is just a technique, not a algorithms.

## 1. How Merge sort works
- `Merge Sort`:
    - `Divide & Conquer`: Divide an array every part has sorted and then all every single parts combined and make will an sorted array.

## 2. Conquer Theory
- There have two sorted array's and then make a single sorted array with this two array's combination.

## 4. Conquer Implementation
- Program: `conquer.cpp`
