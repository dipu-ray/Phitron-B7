## 0. Introduction
- Operators
- Arithmetic Operators
- Relational Operators
- Logical Operators
- Conditional Statements
- Nested If-Else

## 1. Arithmetic Operators
- Program: `arithmetic_operators.c`
- `+`
- `-`
- `*`
- `/`
- `%`

## 2. Modulus Operators
- Program: `modulus_operators.c`
- `%`

## 3. Relational Operators
- Less than `<`
- Less or equal than `<=`
- Greater than `>`
- Greater or equal than `>=`
- Equals to `==`
- Not equals to `!=`

## 4. Logical Operators
- Logical AND `&&`
- Logical OR `||`
- Logical NOT `!`

## 5. Logical Operator Animated
- AND
    - `T && T = T`
    - `T && F = F`
    - `F && T = F`
    - `F && F = F`

- OR 
    - `T || T = T`
    - `T || F = T`
    - `F || T = T`
    - `F || F = F`

- NOT
    - `!T = F`
    - `!F = T`

## 6. Conditional Statement Type 1 Animated
- Example with two conditions

## 7. If else
- Program: `conditions.c`

## 8. Conditional Statement Type 2 Animated
- Example with three conditions

## 9. If else ladder
- Program: `conditions_ladder.c`
- If else ladder is multiple conditions

## 10. Conditional Statement Type 3 Animated
- Conditions into conditions

## 11. Nested if else
- Program: `nested_conditions.c`

## 12. Nested if else Animated

## 13. If else variation
- Multiple ladder conditions use without else
- They have so many conditions variation

## 14. Summary
- Knowing some operators
- Arithmetic operators
- Modulus operators
- Relational operators
- Logical operators
- Knowing conditional related
- Conditions variations
- Nested conditions
- Conditions ladder
