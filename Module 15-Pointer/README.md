## 0. Introduction
- Know to new concept this name is `pointer`.
- Understanding pointers memory addresses.
- Dereferencing a pointer: Accessing the value.
- `Pass by value` vs `pass by reference`.
- Pointers in array: Natural connection.
- Function with array: Practical Applications.

## 1. Pointer
- Pointer variable is normal variable
- Every variable have an address with hexadecimal.
- Program: `pointers.c`
- A variable address access with `%p` format specifier.
- `%p` came from pointers.
- How to pointer variable syntax:
    - `data_type* pointer_variable_name;`

## 2. Dereferencing a pointer
- Pointer variable size can `8 bytes`.
- Program: `dereferencing_pointer.c`
- Access with address a specific variable with `dereferencing a pointer`.
    - Example: `printf("%d", &variable_name);`
- Go to address to value, this called to dereference.
- Go to value to address, this called to reference.

## 3. Pointer Animated
- Explanation pointer

## 4. Pass by value
- Program: `pass_by_value.c`
- They have two different variable and no access.

## 5. Pass by reference
- Program: `pass_by_reference.c`
